Bulldogs Maze
-Existing maze games lack realism and dynamism. I aimed to break away from this trend by incorporating advanced features, such as dynamic vehicle control and realistic physics simulations.
-A THREE.js maze game that transcends the conventional, offering players a novel experience through the fusion of Georgia football theme and dynamic gameplay.
